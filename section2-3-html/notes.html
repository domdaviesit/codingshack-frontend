  <h1>Coding Shack HTML Notes</h1>
  <p>Everything that follows a block element(uses all available space) gets pushed down the page.</p>
  <h3>div and span</h3>
  <p>They are generic and should be used when other elements aren't suitable.</p>
  <p>div is block level and fills all the available width. Everything before the div is pushed up and after is pushed down.divs
    are great for grouping elements together and for areas that can be manipulated by JavaScript. Can put other elements
    in a div.</p>
  <p>Spans are inline it's just a grouping element. Doesn't disrupt the flow of the html doc.</p>
  <div>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Necessitatibus, odio.</div>

  <h3>The DOM</h3>
  <p>The way the browser sees your HTML file ( a hierarchy ).</p>

  <h3>More semantic tags</h3>
  <h4>section</h4>
  <p>section is like a semantic div. Is great for structuring a document, each section with it's own heading.</p>

  <p>HTML introduced "semantic tags", meant to enforce the meaning (or 'semantics') of the information in a webpage. "Article"
    is one of these tags. It represents a self-contained unit of composition in a document. As such, it can have a header
    and a footer. That said, the relationship between H1-6 and Header is that of child-parent, WHEN necessary: That means,
    a Header is more of a grouping element for "introductory" content (as its brother, the "footer") and it "might" contain
    a H1-6 tag, but this is not a necessity (think about a header containing only a navigation bar, for example). More in
    general, whenever in doubt I highly advise to use
    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/HTML/Element/article">Mozilla MDN documentation</a> to deep dive into the topics you want to know more about. </p>
  <p>Headers and Footers are semantically connected to the element that "contains" them (so, when you refer to the "header"
    you generally refer to the position/semantic of the element in respect to the container element). The header tag is generally
    used as a container for "heading" content, or "introductory" content to your page/area/panel. The header is often used
    to contain a main navigation, or a big image or whatever introductory content you want to provide in your page/section/panel.
    Similarly, the Footer is used to group content you want to put at the "bottom" of your content (like terms and condition,
    about us etc in a typical website). Like their names imply, you use "header" and "footer" just a grouping elements, to
    put content that you semantically want to be at the "top" (introduction) or at the "bottom" of your document/area/panel.
  </p>
  <p>Article - (block level) a self contained piece of content. It is a sectioning element but mainly for a unit of content
    like a blog post, comment or forum post.</p>
  <p>Articles can have headers and footers if the content is more than a simple header.</p>
